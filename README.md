# Welcome to your SpaceX

To get started straight away run `yarn dev` and open [localhost:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173/). It may take a while to build install the packages the first time

```bash
yarn dev
```

## First installation

Clone the SpaceX repo:  `git clone git@github.com:joeldavuk/spacex.git`
Run `yarn` to install all the packages and then `yarn dev` to start the app in development mode

## Roadmap

- Add unit tests, with MSW
- Add Global State Management if needed
- Error Handling, Error Boundaries
- Add general theme config
- SSR
